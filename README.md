I've done all tasks maybe there are minor things left on the frontend side but the backend is all completed.<br>
Task1: All completed<br>
Task2: Start project and http://127.0.0.1:8000/objective2 URL it returns JSON solved data<br>
Task3: I'm not able to import DB but I write queries according to my understanding please review the code so you will understand.<br>
Task4: Start project and http://127.0.0.1:8000/objective4 URL it returns JSON solved data<br><br>

please forward this to the reviewer so he/she will understand what have to do.<br><br>

Looking forward to the positive response from your side.<br><br>

Thanks
